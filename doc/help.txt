==============================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                           *yaml.nvim-usage*

This plugins offers the following commands:

:YAMLView                                                          *:YAMLView*

    Shows the full path and value of the key/value pair under the cursor. It
    collects all nested keys and outputs them as a dot-case string (e.g.:
    `root.parent.child.key = value`). It uses Lua's `vim.notify` function to
    show the value to the user.

:YAMLYank [register]                                               *:YAMLYank*

    Yanks the full path and value of the key/value pair under the cursor to
    the selected register. The default register is the unnamed one (see
    |:quotequote|).

    It collects all nested keys and outputs them as a dot-case string (e.g.:
    `root.parent.child.key = value`).

:YAMLYankKey [register]                                         *:YAMLYankKey*

    Yanks the full path of the key of the key/value pair under the cursor to
    the selected register. The default register is the unnamed one (see
    |:quotequote|).

    It collects all nested keys and outputs them as a dot-case string (e.g.:
    `root.parent.child.key`).

:YAMLYankValue [register]                                     *:YAMLYankValue*

    Yanks the value of the key/value pair under the cursor to the selected

:YAMLQuickfix                                                   *YAMLQuickfix*

    Creates a |:quickfix| list with the contents of the YAML, showing the full
    path and value of the key/value pairs of the current YAML file. It
    collects all nested keys and outputs them as a dot-case string (e.g.:
    `root.parent.child.key = value`). It uses Vim's native |:cex| function, so
    the cursor is positioned in the first selection of the |:quickfix|.

:YAMLSnacks                                                       *YAMLSnacks*

    Creates a |:quickfix| list as in |:YAMLQuickfix|, and loads it with
    |:telescope.nvim| using |:telescope.builtin|'s `quickfix()` function. Only
    available if |:telescope.nvim| is installed.

:YAMLFzfLua                                                       *YAMLFzfLua*
